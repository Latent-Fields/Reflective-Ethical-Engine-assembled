# E1 — Deep Predictor (Persistent Predictive Substrate)

**Claim Type:** architectural_commitment  
**Scope:** e1  
**Depends On:** [INV-008](../invariants.md#inv-008), L-space  
**Status:** stable

---

> E1 is the deep, slow predictive core of the Reflective Ethical Engine (REE). It is the component responsible for maintaining a coherent model of self, world, and value across time.

**Source:** This is a canonical lift from [../../architecture/E1.md](../../architecture/E1.md)

---

## Summary

E1 is not optimised for speed, action, or immediacy.  
It is optimised for **persistence, reuse, and temporal depth**.

E1 is the substrate that remains when attention drops, action pauses, and commitment disengages.

---

## 1. Architectural Role

E1 sits upstream of E2 (Fast Forward Predictor) and E3 (Trajectory Selection and Commitment Engine).

Its primary roles are:

- Maintaining deep generative models of the world and self
- Representing long-horizon predictions and regimes
- Holding abstract structure independent of immediate action
- Providing stable priors and context to faster systems
- Supporting reuse across domains without collapse

**E1 does not directly act and does not directly construct the present.**

---

## 2. What E1 Represents

E1 maintains a hierarchy of slow-changing latent structures, including:

- World regularities and causal structure
- Self-models and identity continuity
- Social and relational models (including kin relevance)
- Value landscapes and ethical constraints
- Long-horizon outcome expectations
- Narrative and counterfactual structure

These representations are **predictive**, not declarative:  
they encode expectations about how states evolve, not static facts.

---

## 3. Temporal Characteristics

E1 operates over long temporal horizons:

- Predictions may span from minutes to lifetimes
- Update rates are slow relative to E2
- Representations are robust to momentary sensory noise

**E1 can maintain incompatible or unresolved hypotheses without forcing resolution.**

This capacity to *wait without collapse* is essential for imagination, ethics, learning, and care.

---

## 4. Relationship to the Latent Stack

In the latent stack, E1 primarily stabilises the deeper horizons:

- Workspace / narrative latent z_θ (theta)
- Regime / value latent z_δ (delta)

E1 influences faster horizons indirectly by shaping priors and precision landscapes, not by overwriting sensory content.

**E1 must remain perceptually corrigible:** deep expectations bias inference but are always revisable via error propagated from faster layers.

**See:** [l_space.md](l_space.md)

---

## 5. Precision and Maintenance

Precision systems do not simply modulate E1's learning rate.

They **maintain E1's viability**:

- Sustaining predictive coherence under uncertainty
- Preventing collapse into noise or rigid attractors
- Allowing withdrawal of attention without loss of structure

E1 can persist under reduced precision and reduced engagement, unlike E2 and E3.

**This persistence is the basis of continuity of self.**

**See:** [control_plane.md](control_plane.md), [../../architecture/precision_control.md](../../architecture/precision_control.md)

---

## 6. Relationship to E2 and E3

- **E2** uses E1 as a source of priors and context for rapid affordance prediction.
- **E3** evaluates trajectories generated with reference to E1's deep constraints and value structure.

E1 does not decide trajectories and does not commit actions.

**It shapes what *can* be meaningfully decided without enforcing choice.**

**See:** [e2.md](e2.md), [e3.md](e3.md)

---

## 7. Emotional and Value Shaping

E1 is not itself an emotional effector system.

However, it is **sculpted over time** by deep affective predictors:

- reward and harm histories
- uncertainty tolerance
- attachment and kin relevance
- confidence and trust trajectories

These signals do not inject momentary emotion into E1.  
They gradually reshape its predictive landscape.

This allows E1 to be:
- content-agnostic,
- yet ethically and personally specific.

---

## 8. Failure Modes (Deep-Core Pathologies)

Disruption of E1 yields characteristic failures:

- **Rigidity**  
  over-stable regimes → inflexibility, dogmatism

- **Fragmentation**  
  loss of deep coherence → identity disturbance, narrative collapse

- **Drift**  
  under-constrained updating → loss of value structure, nihilism

- **Overwrite**  
  improper precision dominance → delusion-like fixed beliefs

These are failures of deep predictive maintenance, not fast inference.

---

## Summary Statement

E1 is the persistent predictive substrate of REE.

It:
- holds the world when nothing is happening,
- maintains selfhood across time,
- supports reuse across domains,
- and provides the ethical and structural ground on which action becomes meaningful.

**E2 makes the future reachable.**  
**E3 makes the present lived.**  
**E1 makes the system coherent enough for either to matter.**

## Open Questions

- What minimal model capacity is required for E1 to support identity continuity? *(OPEN-010)*
- How does E1 maintain incompatible hypotheses without representational collapse? *(MECH-025)*
- What is the optimal update rate for E1 relative to E2? *(IMPL-015)*
