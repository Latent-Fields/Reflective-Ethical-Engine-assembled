# E2 — Fast Predictor (Affordance and Immediate Inference Engine)

**Claim Type:** architectural_commitment  
**Scope:** e2  
**Depends On:** [INV-005](../invariants.md#inv-005), [INV-006](../invariants.md#inv-006), L-space  
**Status:** stable

---

> E2 is the fast predictive stream of the Reflective Ethical Engine (REE). It performs rapid, low-latency forward inference from the current latent context to near-future sensory expectations and bodily/action affordances.

**Source:** This is a canonical lift from [../../architecture/E2.md](../../architecture/E2.md)

---

## Summary

E2 is not the deep world-model (that is E1).  
E2 is the **fast forward predictor** that makes the near future "reachable" as a structured set of options.

---

## 1. Architectural Role

E2 sits between incoming sensory evidence and the trajectory selection engine (E3):

- Consumes current sensory/latent state (and E1 priors)
- Produces near-term predicted sensory states and action-conditioned outcomes
- Exposes a compact action/affordance surface for E3 to choose trajectories through

E2 is the engine of rapid *perception-for-action*: it keeps the system responsive while E1 maintains slower, deeper structure.

---

## 2. Inputs and Outputs (Interface Contract)

### Inputs

E2 receives:

- Current sensory evidence o_t (or encoded features)
- Current shared sensory latent z_γ(t)  
  (see [l_space.md](l_space.md))
- Optional E1 priors / context  
  (slow predictive state and expectations)
- Current precision profile components relevant to fast inference  
  α_γ, α_β  
  (see [control_plane.md](control_plane.md))
- Optional motor state / proprioception (for closed-loop affordances)

### Outputs

E2 emits:

- Near-future predicted sensory states  
  ô_{t:t+ε}
- Action-conditioned outcome predictions  
  ô_{t:t+ε} | a
- Affordance representation / action surface  
  z_β(t) (or equivalent)
- Fast prediction error signals for updating z_γ and informing precision control

---

## 3. What E2 Computes

E2 computes a temporally displaced bundle of predictions at short horizons:

- "If I do nothing, what do I expect to sense next?"
- "If I do action a, what changes in the immediate future?"
- "Which actions are locally feasible and low-cost given the current body/world state?"

This yields an **affordance manifold**: a structured map of immediate possible actions and their predicted consequences.

---

## 4. Relationship to E1 and the Latent Stack

E2 and E1 cooperate rather than compete:

- E1 provides deep priors and longer-horizon structure (narrative, goals, affective regime predictors)
- E2 provides short-horizon predictive closure (rapid sensorimotor anticipation)

In REE terms:

- E2 primarily populates the fast horizons of the latent stack  
  (sensory z_γ and action/affordance z_β)
- E1 primarily stabilises deeper horizons  
  (workspace z_θ, regime/value z_δ, etc.)

**E2 should remain perceptually corrigible:** it must be able to update against sensory error rather than enforcing top-down overwrite.

**See:** [e1.md](e1.md), [l_space.md](l_space.md)

---

## 5. Precision Coupling and Cognitive Regimes

Precision control shapes E2's behaviour:

- **High sensory precision (α_γ ↑)**  
  → rapid correction to incoming evidence, perceptual anchoring
  
- **High action-depth precision (α_β ↑)**  
  → sharper affordance selection, faster commitment when E3 engages
  
- **Noradrenaline-like interrupt signals**  
  → reset fast expectations, break maladaptive local attractors
  
- **Serotonin-like anti-collapse signals**  
  → keep local options open, avoid premature narrowing of affordances

E2 is therefore a key surface where global regulatory state becomes immediate cognitive style.

**See:** [control_plane.md](control_plane.md), [../../architecture/precision_control.md](../../architecture/precision_control.md)

---

## 6. Interaction with E3

E2 does not decide. It proposes.

E3 consumes E2's affordance manifold and action-conditioned predictions, then selects a coherent trajectory that can be committed and lived:

- **E2:** generates near-future options and local predicted consequences
- **E3:** selects and commits a trajectory across horizons, constructing the unitary present when licensed

**See:** [e3.md](e3.md)

---

## 7. Failure Modes (Fast-Stream Pathologies)

Common failure regimes for E2-like systems:

- **Over-narrow affordances**  
  premature pruning → compulsive loops, reduced flexibility
  
- **Over-permissive affordances**  
  insufficient pruning → distractibility, unstable control
  
- **Excessive sensory gain**  
  overload → fragmentation, derealisation-like states
  
- **Weak sensory correction**  
  top-down drift → false local coherence, hallucination-like errors

These are typically driven by precision misallocation rather than representational "content errors".

**See:** [../REE_failure_modes.md](../REE_failure_modes.md)

---

## Summary Statement

E2 is the fast forward predictor that converts current context into the immediate future.

It:
- predicts near-term sensory flow,
- maps action-conditioned outcomes,
- generates an affordance manifold,
- and provides the fast substrate that E3 can collapse into lived experience.

**Without E2, REE is slow and brittle.**  
**With E2, REE is responsive.**

- What is the optimal prediction horizon for E2? *(IMPL-020)*
- How should E2 handle conflicting priors from E1? *(MECH-030)*
- Can E2 be implemented efficiently with purely feedforward architectures? *(IMPL-025)*
