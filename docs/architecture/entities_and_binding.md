# Entities and Binding

**Claim Type:** architectural_commitment  
**Scope:** Entity representation; sparse, persistent, bindable structures  
**Depends On:** [L-space](l_space.md), INV-002 (coherence includes temporal binding)  
**Status:** provisional

---

## Role in REE

Entities in the Reflective Ethical Engine (REE) are sparse, persistent, bindable structures that emerge within the latent stack.

They are **not** forced symbols or pre-defined ontological categories.  
They are **not** denied either.

Entities are emergent but real variables that:
- maintain coherence across time
- support error ownership and attribution
- enable structured prediction and binding

---

## Architectural Commitment

From DANIEL_README.md Layer 3:

> **Entities as emergent but real variables**
> - Sparse, persistent, bindable structures
> - Not forced symbols, but not denied either
> - Error ownership is entity-linked

---

## Relationship to L-space

Entities emerge within the latent stack as coherent structures that:
- persist across multiple time steps
- bind features and predictions
- support phase-compatible temporal alignment (per INV-002)

---

## Error Ownership

Prediction errors in REE are not global.  
They are attributed to specific entities or entity-like structures.

This enables:
- targeted model updates
- localized precision control
- structured learning without global collapse

---

## Status Note

This document represents a provisional architectural commitment extracted from DANIEL_README.md.

Further elaboration is needed to specify:
- entity emergence mechanisms
- binding constraints and timing
- interaction with precision control
- relationship to social cognition (self/other modeling)
