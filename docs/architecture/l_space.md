# L-Space — Latent Stack (Multi-Depth Stratified Latent Space)

**Claim Type:** architectural_commitment  
**Scope:** l_space  
**Depends On:** [INV-005](../invariants.md#inv-005), Multi-timescale prediction  
**Status:** stable

---

> REE uses a multi-timescale latent stack to represent temporally displaced prediction depths operating over two primary representational domains: (1) a **shared sensory latent** that fuses modality-specific evidence, and (2) a downstream **affordance / action latent** generated by fast forward prediction.

**Source:** This is a canonical lift from [../../architecture/latent_stack.md](../../architecture/latent_stack.md)

---

## Summary

The latent stack (L-space) is organised by **timescale**, not by sensory modality.  
Sensory modalities are fused *before* entering the stack into a shared sensory latent z_S.

---

## Minimal Implementation Interface

Implement each depth k ∈ {γ, β, θ, δ} with:

- `encode_k(o_t, prev_state)` → `z_k(t)`
- `predict_k(z_k(t))` → `z_k(t+1)`
- `topdown_kplus1_to_k(z_{k+1}(t))` → prior / conditioning signal for depth k

## The Four Canonical Depths

### γ (gamma) — Shared Sensory Binding Layer
**Timescale:** ~100ms (fast)  
**Function:** Shared sensory binding / feature conjunction (multimodal evidence + precision)

This level represents the completed perceptual state z_S.  
Represents immediate sensory features and object binding.

**Neuromodulator Analog:** Acetylcholine (sensory precision)

---

### β (beta) — Affordance and Action Layer
**Timescale:** ~500ms (intermediate)  
**Function:** Affordance and immediate action-set maintenance

Fast forward predictions from z_γ expand into a candidate affordance/action latent z_A.  
Represents available actions and their immediate consequences.

**Neuromodulator Analog:** Dopamine (action selection precision)

---

### θ (theta) — Sequence Context Layer
**Timescale:** ~2-5 seconds (slow)  
**Function:** Sequence context, temporal ordering, and short-horizon narrative structure

Maintains temporal context and sequential dependencies over candidate trajectories.

**Neuromodulator Analog:** Noradrenaline (context stability)

---

### δ (delta) — Regime and Motivation Layer
**Timescale:** Minutes to hours (very slow)  
**Function:** Regime, motivational set, long-horizon context, and default-mode attractor

Biases selection but does not overwrite perception.  
Represents long-term goals and motivational state.

**Neuromodulator Analog:** Serotonin (horizon width, anti-collapse)

---

## Representational Constraints

### Perceptual Corrigibility
**Downstream processes may not directly overwrite z_γ.**

Influence is restricted to:
- Prediction-error updates
- Precision (gain) modulation

This preserves perceptual corrigibility: illusions and misperceptions arise from misweighted precision or suppressed error, not from semantic overwrite of sensory state.

## Temporal Displacement and the Constructed Present

**Critical concept:** The latent stack does not represent a single "now".

It represents a **temporally displaced bundle of predictions** across multiple future offsets, stratified by depth.

A unitary present-moment experience is not a property of z_γ alone. It is constructed downstream when a **trajectory** through the displaced bundle is selected and committed (see [../../architecture/trajectory_selection.md](../../architecture/trajectory_selection.md)):

### In Committed / Task-Engaged Mode
Commitment phase-aligns temporally displaced predictions with motor execution timing, enforcing cross-horizon coherence so the unfolding trajectory is experienced as a single present.

**See:** [e3.md](e3.md) — Committed regime

### In Default Mode
Displaced rollouts are explored without commitment or phase-locking to action (see [../../architecture/Default_mode.md](../../architecture/Default_mode.md)), and therefore do not construct a unitary present-moment "now".

## Oscillatory Phase and Cross-Horizon Coordination

REE does not require explicit oscillations for v0. Oscillatory phase can be added later as a scheduling / gating mechanism.

**Conceptually:** Oscillatory nesting is treated as the carrier for cross-horizon coordination.

Different predictive depths can be coupled (or decoupled) by phase-aligned gating, enabling stable multi-timescale coherence without allowing deeper regimes to overwrite sensory state.

**See:** [../../architecture/depth_phase_spec.md](../../architecture/depth_phase_spec.md), [../../architecture/Hippocampal_braid.md](../../architecture/Hippocampal_braid.md)

## Relationship to E1, E2, E3

### E1 (Deep Predictor)
- Primarily stabilises deeper horizons: z_θ (workspace/narrative) and z_δ (regime/value)
- Provides stable priors and context to faster systems
- Maintains long-horizon structure

**See:** [e1.md](e1.md)

### E2 (Fast Predictor)
- Primarily populates fast horizons: z_γ (sensory) and z_β (affordance/action)
- Provides short-horizon predictive closure
- Generates affordance manifold

**See:** [e2.md](e2.md)

### E3 (Trajectory Selector)
- Selects coherent trajectory across all depths
- Constructs unitary present when commitment occurs
- Uses precision profile across depths for selection

**See:** [e3.md](e3.md)

## Summary Statement

L-space is the stratified latent substrate over which REE operates.

It:
- Separates timescales without separating modalities
- Enables multi-horizon prediction without collapse
- Preserves perceptual corrigibility through update restrictions
- Supports both committed action and uncommitted exploration

**The latent stack is not a hierarchy of abstraction — it is a stratification of temporal horizons.**

## Open Questions

- What is the minimal number of depths required for REE compliance? *(OPEN-004)*
- Can depths be dynamically allocated/deallocated? *(MECH-040)*
- How should z_γ handle cross-modal binding conflicts? *(IMPL-035)*

- **INV-006:** Attention as precision modulation — operates on L-space depths
- **INV-008:** Imagination without belief update — enabled by temporal displacement
- **ARCH-001:** Multi-timescale prediction architecture
