# REE Documentation Refactoring — Final Output

**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Process:** 8-Phase Systematic Documentation Refactoring  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Executive Summary

- ✓ Zero circular dependencies
- ✓ Zero documented conflicts
- ✓ 100% content preservation
- ✓ Canonical location for each core concept
- ✓ Machine-readable claim registry
- ✓ Human-readable navigation

## 3. Detected Conflicts

**Count:** 0

### Consistency Analysis Results

✅ **Dependency Check**
- No circular dependencies detected
- All invariants depend only on other invariants
- No architectural commitments depend on mechanism hypotheses inappropriately

✅ **Contradiction Check**
- No claims with same subject and incompatible polarity
- No mutually exclusive architectural commitments

✅ **Classification Safety**
- All invariants have conservative classification
- No downgrade required

### Potential Semantic Variations (Flagged for Future Review)

These are not conflicts but areas requiring clarification:

1. **E1 Implementation Details**
   - **Location:** DANIEL_README.md Layer 3
   - **Claim:** "E1 is a predictive field, not a deep network; shallow, recurrent, multi-rate"
   - **Status:** Not yet formalized as claim
   - **Recommendation:** Add as MECH-003 or expand ARC-001

2. **Self Definition Prominence**
   - **Location:** REE_CORE.md §4
   - **Definition:** "Self is the currently committed trajectory prefix"
   - **Status:** Strong operational definition not elevated to formal claim
   - **Recommendation:** Add as ARC-010 or potentially INV-018

3. **Phase Compatibility Details**
   - **Location:** architecture/depth_phase_spec.md
   - **Status:** Detailed specification marked as MECH-001 (candidate)
   - **Recommendation:** Clarify if candidate hypothesis or required architecture

---

## 4. Classification Uncertainties

### Items Flagged for Review

#### 1. Entities and Binding (ARC-009)
- **Current Status:** Provisional
- **Reason:** Extracted from DANIEL_README.md; needs fuller specification
- **Missing Elements:**
  - Detailed emergence mechanisms
  - Binding constraint formalization
  - Interaction with precision control
  - Relationship to social cognition
- **Recommendation:** Expand document with mechanisms and validation criteria

#### 2. Phase Compatibility (MECH-001)
- **Current Status:** Candidate
- **Issue:** Detailed normative specification in depth_phase_spec.md
- **Question:** Is this a hypothesis to test or an architectural requirement?
- **Recommendation:** Test and validate; promote to ARC or clarify as experimental

#### 3. τ-Scoped Precision (MECH-002)
- **Current Status:** Candidate
- **Issue:** Uses normative "MUST" language but marked as hypothesis
- **Question:** Is this a mechanism hypothesis or architectural invariant?
- **Recommendation:** Review precision_scoping.md and reclassify if needed

### Successfully Classified (No Uncertainty)

All 17 invariants have clear, conservative classification with no borderline cases.

All stable architectural commitments (8 of 9) have unambiguous status.

## 7. Global Rules Compliance

All seven global rules were strictly followed:

| Rule | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1. Do not delete content | ✅ Pass | 0 files deleted; all content preserved |
| 2. Preserve original wording | ✅ Pass | Content migrated verbatim; claim headers added only |
| 3. Never silently change meaning | ✅ Pass | No semantic changes made |
| 4. Never silently promote/demote claims | ✅ Pass | All claim types explicitly documented |
| 5. Never resolve contradictions by choosing winner | ✅ Pass | No conflicts found; would document if found |
| 6. If unsure, classify as mechanism_hypothesis | ✅ Pass | 3 items marked provisional/candidate |
| 7. Treat invariants as scarce and conservative | ✅ Pass | 17 invariants, all clearly justified |

## 9. Next Steps (Deferred for Future Work)

The following items were identified but deferred:

### High Priority

1. **Add Self Definition as Formal Claim**
   - Extract from REE_CORE.md §4
   - Classify as ARC-010 or potentially INV-018
   - Link to commitment and hippocampal braid claims

2. **Formalize E1 Implementation Constraint**
   - Extract from DANIEL_README.md Layer 3 §1
   - Add as MECH-003 or expand ARC-001
   - Clarify "field vs. network" distinction

3. **Expand Entities and Binding (ARC-009)**
   - Detail emergence mechanisms
   - Formalize binding constraints
   - Move from provisional to stable

### Medium Priority

4. **Update docs/glossary.md**
   - Link all terms to canonical definitions
   - Add claim IDs where appropriate
   - Ensure consistency with canonical docs

5. **Add Claim Typing to Supplementary Files**
   - `architecture/trajectory_selection.md`
   - `architecture/depth_phase_spec.md`
   - `architecture/precision_scoping.md`
   - Other supplementary architecture files

6. **Review REE_overview.md**
   - Check consistency with canonical docs
   - Update links to point to canonical locations
   - Add claim typing if appropriate

### Low Priority

7. **Consolidate Duplicate Content**
   - Review overlaps between trajectory_selection.md and e3.md
   - Determine canonical vs. supplementary status
   - Add explicit cross-references

8. **Create Hypotheses Directory**
   - If mechanism hypotheses grow beyond 5-10
   - Organize by domain (binding, precision, language, etc.)

9. **Periodic Reconciliation**
   - Review which hypotheses have stabilized
   - Promote to architectural commitments if validated
   - Archive superseded hypotheses

## 10. Conclusion

This 8-phase refactoring has successfully established a **structured, dependency-aware, conflict-surfacing documentation system** for the Reflective Ethical Engine.

### What Was Accomplished

✅ **Structure:** Canonical locations for all core concepts  
✅ **Safety:** 100% content preservation, zero deletions  
✅ **Clarity:** 28 typed claims with explicit dependencies  
✅ **Consistency:** Zero circular dependencies, zero conflicts  
✅ **Traceability:** Machine-readable registry + human-readable index  
✅ **Navigation:** Clear reading paths for implementers, researchers, contributors

### What This Enables

- **Systematic Evolution:** Claims can be added, refined, or deprecated with clear impact analysis
- **Falsifiable Testing:** Each claim has explicit dependencies and status
- **Safe Refinement:** DANIEL_README.md process can operate on structured foundation
- **Collaboration:** Multiple contributors can work without hidden conflicts
- **Architectural Integrity:** Invariants are protected; changes must be explicit

### Documentation Philosophy Achieved

> "Do not rewrite the blade to sharpen it. Preserve structure. Protect speculation. Promote slowly. Delete reluctantly."
> — DANIEL_README.md

This refactoring respects REE's core philosophy:
- Invariants remain scarce and conservative
- Hypotheses can overlap and conflict
- Contradictions are surfaced, not resolved
- Structure resists erosion
- Correctness over visibility

The documentation is now ready for systematic evolution while maintaining architectural integrity.
