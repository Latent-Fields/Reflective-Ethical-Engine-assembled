# Documentation Refactoring Changelog

## 2026-02-07: Systematic Documentation Refactoring

### Overview

Completed a comprehensive 8-phase refactoring of REE documentation to create a structured, dependency-aware system that explicitly surfaces inconsistencies rather than resolving them silently.

### Phase 1: Inventory ✓

**Completed:**
- Scanned all documentation files (.md format)
- Identified 56+ markdown files across repository
- Catalogued core concepts: E1, E2, E3, L-space, control plane, residue, entities, binding
- Located repeated definitions and potential conflicts

**Key Findings:**
- Core architecture well-documented in `architecture/` directory
- Three critical root documents: `README.md`, `REE_CORE.md`, `DANIEL_README.md`
- Subsystems organized under: `sleep/`, `language/`, `social/`
- Existing `docs/` directory with REE_MIN_SPEC.md and other specifications

### Phase 2: Canonical Structure ✓

**Created:**
- `docs/README.md` — Navigation guide explaining structure and reading paths
- `docs/invariants.md` — 17 non-negotiable architectural invariants
- `docs/architecture/` — Canonical architecture documents
  - `e1.md`, `e2.md`, `e3.md`
  - `l_space.md` (renamed from latent_stack.md)
  - `control_plane.md`
  - `residue_geometry.md`
  - `default_mode.md`
  - `hippocampal_braid.md`
  - `entities_and_binding.md` (newly synthesized)
- `docs/claims/` — Claim registry directory
- `docs/conflicts/` — Conflict documentation directory (prepared)
- `docs/archive/` — Archive directory (prepared)

**Directory Structure:**
```
docs/
  README.md
  invariants.md
  glossary.md (existing, to be updated)
  MIGRATION.md
  changelog.md (this file)
  architecture/
    e1.md, e2.md, e3.md
    l_space.md
    control_plane.md
    entities_and_binding.md
    residue_geometry.md
    default_mode.md
    hippocampal_braid.md
  claims/
    claim_index.md
    claims.yaml
  conflicts/ (empty)
  archive/ (empty)
```

### Phase 3: Claim Typing ✓

**Applied to 9 canonical architecture files:**

Standard header format:
```markdown
**Claim Type:** [invariant | architectural_commitment | mechanism_hypothesis | open_question | implementation_note]
**Scope:** [Brief description]
**Depends On:** [List of dependencies]
**Status:** [stable | provisional | legacy | candidate]
```

**Files Updated:**
- All 9 canonical architecture files received claim typing headers
- Dependencies explicitly linked
- Status clearly marked

### Phase 4: Content Migration (Partial)

**Completed:**
- Migrated core architecture files to canonical locations
- Preserved original files in `architecture/` for compatibility
- No content deleted or archived yet (per global rules)

**Deferred:**
- Full content consolidation from supplementary files
- Archive migration for superseded content
- Detailed duplicate removal

**Rationale:** Prioritized structure and claim typing over content consolidation to establish foundation first.

### Phase 5: Claim Registry ✓

**Created:**
- `docs/claims/claims.yaml` — Machine-readable registry with full metadata
- `docs/claims/claim_index.md` — Human-readable indexed list

**Claims Documented:**
- **17 Invariants (INV-001 to INV-017)**
  - Core thesis invariants (3): No ethics module, temporal binding, language emergence
  - Safety invariants (4): Persistent ethics, mirror modeling, residue persistence, language constraint
  - Control invariants (2): Routed precision, attention via modulation
  - Mode invariants (3): Offline integration, imagination safety, commitment gates
  - Foundational invariants (5): Predictive cognition, content/control separation, constraint-based ethics, stability priority, control failures

- **9 Architectural Commitments (ARC-001 to ARC-009)**
  - Core components (3): E1, E2, E3
  - Latent/control (3): L-space, control plane, residue geometry
  - Modes/memory (2): Default mode, hippocampal braid
  - Entity representation (1): Entities and binding

- **2 Mechanism Hypotheses (MECH-001 to MECH-002)**
  - Phase compatibility binding (candidate)
  - τ-scoped precision (candidate)

**Total: 28 claims**

### Phase 6: Consistency Pass ✓

**Automated Analysis Results:**
- ✓ No circular dependencies
- ✓ All invariants depend only on other invariants
- ✓ No contradictions detected in same-subject claims
- ✓ No documented conflicts

**Dependency Graph Verified:**
- 11 axiomatic invariants (no dependencies)
- 6 derived invariants (depend on other invariants)
- 9 architectural commitments (depend on invariants and other commitments)
- 2 mechanism hypotheses (depend on invariants and commitments)

**Classification Safety:**
- No invariants depend on hypotheses or open questions ✓
- No architectural commitments promote mechanism hypotheses without justification ✓
- Provisional and candidate statuses appropriately marked ✓

### Phase 7: Linking and Hygiene (Partial)

**Completed:**
- Created `docs/MIGRATION.md` with path mapping
- Internal links within canonical docs point to canonical locations
- Cross-references added to architecture files

**Remaining:**
- Update root documents (`README.md`, `REE_CORE.md`) to reference canonical locations
- Add redirect notes to original `architecture/` files
- Verify all orphaned sections

### Phase 8: Final Output ✓

See sections below.

## Detected Conflicts

**Count:** 0

No formal conflicts detected during consistency analysis. All claims are compatible within their dependency structure.

### Potential Semantic Variations (For Future Review)

1. **E1 Implementation Details**
   - `DANIEL_README.md` describes E1 as "predictive field, not deep network; shallow, recurrent, multi-rate"
   - This detail not prominently featured in canonical `e1.md`
   - **Action:** Consider adding as MECH claim or architectural note

2. **Self Definition Prominence**
   - Strong operational definition in `REE_CORE.md`: "Self is currently committed trajectory prefix"
   - Should be elevated to architectural commitment or invariant
   - **Action:** Add as ARC-010 or INV-018

3. **Phase Compatibility Mechanism**
   - `depth_phase_spec.md` provides detailed phase-coordinate system
   - `precision_scoping.md` provides τ-scoped precision rules
   - Both are mechanism hypotheses (MECH-001, MECH-002)
   - **Action:** Ensure clear status as candidate mechanisms, not committed architecture

---

## Classification Uncertainties

### Items Flagged for Review

1. **Entities and Binding (ARC-009)**
   - Status: Provisional
   - Reason: Extracted from DANIEL_README.md Layer 3; needs fuller specification
   - Recommendation: Expand with detailed emergence mechanisms and binding constraints

2. **Phase Compatibility (MECH-001)**
   - Status: Candidate
   - Reason: Detailed specification exists but marked as hypothesis
   - Recommendation: Test and validate before promoting to architectural commitment

3. **τ-Scoped Precision (MECH-002)**
   - Status: Candidate
   - Reason: Strong normative language ("MUST") but still marked as hypothesis
   - Recommendation: Clarify if this is mechanism hypothesis or architectural requirement

### Items Successfully Classified

All 17 invariants have clear, conservative classification:
- No borderline cases
- No conflicting invariants requiring downgrade
- All dependencies valid

All 9 architectural commitments have stable or provisional status:
- 8 stable
- 1 provisional (entities_and_binding)

---

## Statistics

- **Total Documentation Files:** 56+ markdown files
- **Canonical Architecture Files:** 9
- **Total Claims:** 28
  - Invariants: 17 (60.7%)
  - Architectural Commitments: 9 (32.1%)
  - Mechanism Hypotheses: 2 (7.2%)
- **Claim Statuses:**
  - Active: 17 (invariants)
  - Stable: 8 (architectural commitments)
  - Provisional: 1 (entities_and_binding)
  - Candidate: 2 (mechanism hypotheses)
- **Dependency Relationships:** 35+ documented dependencies
- **Circular Dependencies:** 0
- **Documented Conflicts:** 0

---

## Principles Followed

All global rules were respected:

1. ✓ No content deleted
2. ✓ Original wording preserved where possible
3. ✓ No silent meaning changes
4. ✓ No silent claim type changes
5. ✓ No contradictions resolved by choosing "winner"
6. ✓ Uncertain classifications marked as provisional/candidate
7. ✓ Invariants treated conservatively

---

## Next Steps (Deferred)

The following items were identified but deferred for future work:

1. Update root `README.md` to link to canonical docs
2. Add superseded/redirect notes to original `architecture/` files
3. Expand entities_and_binding.md with detailed mechanisms
4. Review and consolidate duplicate content across supplementary files
5. Add claim typing to remaining `architecture/` files (supplementary)
6. Update `docs/glossary.md` to reference canonical definitions
7. Review `docs/REE_overview.md` for consistency with canonical docs
8. Add Self operational definition as formal claim (ARC-010 or INV-018)
9. Formalize E1 implementation constraint as mechanism hypothesis
10. Create hypotheses directory if mechanism claims grow beyond 5-10

---

## Conclusion

This refactoring establishes a solid foundation for REE documentation:
- Clear dependency structure
- Explicit claim typing
- No hidden conflicts
- Preserved content safety
- Machine-readable registry
- Human-readable navigation

The documentation is now ready for:
- Systematic evolution via the claim registry
- Safe refinement following DANIEL_README.md process
- Falsifiable architectural testing
- Multi-contributor collaboration with clear change boundaries
