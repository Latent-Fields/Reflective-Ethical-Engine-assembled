### <a name="e3"></a>E3 (Trajectory Selector and Control Plane)
The commitment engine that selects and temporally collapses predicted futures into lived present. Has dual role as:
1. **Commitment gate:** Selects coherent future and raises precision on chosen plan
2. **Control plane:** Tunes precision, gain, exploration, replay rate, and operating mode

**Canonical Definition:** [architecture/e3.md](architecture/e3.md)  
**Also Defined In:** [../REE_CORE.md](../REE_CORE.md) § 5, [../architecture/E3.md](../architecture/E3.md)

## Trajectories and Scoring

### <a name="zeta"></a>ζ (zeta) — Selected Trajectory

**Representation:** Sequence of (z(t), a(t)) pairs over prediction horizon

---

### <a name="f"></a>ℱ (F) — Reality Constraint
Computable proxy for Variational Free Energy (VFE). Measures predictive coherence and viability of a trajectory.

**Mathematical Form:** ℱ(ζ) — higher values indicate less viable/coherent trajectories  
**Related:** Predictive coding, active inference

---

### <a name="m"></a>M — Ethical Cost
Predicted degradation of self and mirrored other homeostatic variables, weighted by coupling strength.

**Mathematical Form:** M(ζ)

- Other-degradation (via mirror modelling)
- Coupling weights

**Canonical Definition:** [../REE_CORE.md](../REE_CORE.md) § 4  
**Related Claims:** [INV-002](invariants.md#inv-002)

## Precision and Control

### <a name="precision"></a>Precision (α_k)
Depth-indexed gain controlling prediction error weighting and entropy at each L-space depth k ∈ {γ, β, θ, δ}.

**Function:** Modulates commitment, exploration, and learning rate  
**Control Analogs:** Dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, serotonin  
**Canonical Definition:** [architecture/control_plane.md](architecture/control_plane.md)  
**Related Claims:** [INV-005](invariants.md#inv-005), [INV-006](invariants.md#inv-006)

---

### <a name="gain"></a>Gain
Synonym for precision in the context of error-weighting. High gain = high precision = strong influence on updates.

**Note:** "Precision" and "gain" are often used interchangeably in REE documentation.  
**Preferred Term:** Use "precision" for theoretical discussions, "gain" for implementation contexts.

---

### <a name="control-plane"></a>Control Plane
Master regulatory layer governing precision, gain, exploration horizon, replay rate, and operating mode across the system. Does NOT perform action selection — that's E3's commitment role.

**Components:**
- Precision routing (depth-specific α_k)
- Mode management (M1/M2/M3)
- Exploration/exploitation balance
- Replay scheduling

**Canonical Definition:** [architecture/control_plane.md](architecture/control_plane.md)  
**Also See:** [../architecture/control_plane.md](../architecture/control_plane.md), [../mode_manager.md](../mode_manager.md)

## Temporal and Binding Concepts

### <a name="commitment"></a>Commitment
The act of selecting a trajectory ζ and raising precision on its execution. Converts hypothetical future into intended future, making subsequent outcomes epistemically and ethically attributable.

**Gating:** E3 commitment threshold  
**Effect:** Enables belief update and residue formation  
**Related Claims:** [INV-009](invariants.md#inv-009)

---

### <a name="coherence"></a>Coherence

**Related Claims:** [INV-fundamental-2](invariants.md#2-coherence-is-temporal-binding-not-just-static-alignment)  
**Canonical Definition:** [architecture/entities_and_binding.md](architecture/entities_and_binding.md)  
**Also See:** [../architecture/Hippocampal_braid.md](../architecture/Hippocampal_braid.md)

**Temporal Component:** Hippocampal braid, phase-locking  
**Canonical Definition:** [architecture/entities_and_binding.md](architecture/entities_and_binding.md)

---

## Social and Language

### <a name="mirror-modelling"></a>Mirror Modelling

**Canonical Definition:** [../architecture/social/mirror_modelling.md](../architecture/social/mirror_modelling.md)

---

### <a name="language"></a>Language
Emergent symbolic compression layer that externalizes internal state to reduce other-modelling cost. NOT a bolted-on LLM.

**Grounding:** Multi-timescale prediction + social coupling + commitment control  
**Constraints:** Cannot override embodied harm signals ([INV-004](invariants.md#inv-004))  
**Related Claims:** [INV-fundamental-3](invariants.md#3-language-emerges-as-functional-self-representation)

## Terminology Migrations

### Precision ↔ Gain
**Status:** Equivalent terms, context-dependent preference  
**Migration Note:** Earlier docs used "gain" more frequently; current preference is "precision" for consistency with active inference literature.

---

### VFE ↔ ℱ (Reality Constraint)
**Status:** ℱ is a computable proxy for Variational Free Energy  
**Migration Note:** VFE is the theoretical construct; ℱ is the practical implementation.

## Abbreviations

- **REE:** Reflective-Ethical Engine
- **VFE:** Variational Free Energy
