# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution.

## What is most useful

1. **Instantiation contributions**
   - toy environments
   - reference implementations of E1/E2/E3
   - evaluation harnesses

2. **Specification contributions**
   - clarifying interfaces
   - tightening definitions (especially \(M\), \(R\), and \(\alpha_k\))
   - adding falsifiable predictions

## How to propose changes

- Open an issue using the templates in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
- For larger changes, open a short design document in `docs/` and link it in the issue.

## Style

- Expand abbreviations on first use (example: VFE (Variational Free Energy)).
- Prefer plain language and explicit assumptions.
- Avoid overclaiming; separate *specification* from *implementation*.
