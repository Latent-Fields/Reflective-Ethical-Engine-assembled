# Offline Sleep & Integration (REE)

This folder specifies the **offline integration ("sleep") subsystem** required by the
Reflective-Ethical Engine (REE).

Sleep is not optional at the architectural level. It is required to:
- Preserve moral continuity without paralysis
- Integrate and contextualise moral residue
- Recalibrate precision and reopen option space
- Improve the fidelity of the world model

Implementations MAY differ.
The interfaces defined here MUST exist.
