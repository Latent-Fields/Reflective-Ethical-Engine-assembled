# Language & Symbolic Mediation (REE)

This folder specifies how **language functions within the Reflective-Ethical Engine (REE)**.

REE treats language as an **emergent coordination layer** that arises in sufficiently complex agents,
bootstrapped by lower-bandwidth affective and attentional signals (e.g., distress cues, face/agent-attention biases).

Language is **not** treated as:
- a value source,
- a rule system,
- or a direct optimiser.

Instead, language is a **compressive, social, and temporal coordination layer**
operating over existing predictive and ethical machinery.

Language can:
- externalise internal state to reduce other-modelling overhead,
- shape priors and intentions,
- transmit residue warnings and repair commitments,
- scaffold long-horizon planning and coordination.

But language cannot replace embodied harm sensing or ethical cost.

Implementations MAY vary.
The roles and invariants defined here are ARCHITECTURALLY REQUIRED.
