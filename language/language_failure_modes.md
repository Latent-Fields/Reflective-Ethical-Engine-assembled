# Language Failure Modes

When language decouples from embodied ethical signals, failure can be severe.

Common failure modes:
- Rationalisation: language used to suppress or explain away harm signals.
- Ideological capture: fixed symbolic frames override perception and residue.
- Bureaucratic dissociation: harm abstracted until it no longer registers as degradation.
- Moral licensing: symbolic 'good acts' used to justify later harm.
- Reputation substitution: moral residue replaced by social scoring.

These map to REE pathologies:
- residue externalisation,
- precision misrouting,
- other-model collapse,
- spurious residue from narrative contamination.
