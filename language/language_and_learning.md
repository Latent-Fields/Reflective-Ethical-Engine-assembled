# Language and Learning

Language interacts with learning by:
- biasing priors during model update,
- accelerating generalisation of residue,
- enabling counterfactual reasoning without direct experience,
- transmitting "negative knowledge" (what not to do) socially.

However:
- language-learned ethics is brittle without embodiment,
- purely linguistic agents risk ethical drift and rationalisation loops.

REE therefore treats language as:
- a multiplier of ethical learning,
- not a substitute for harm sensing and residue continuity.
