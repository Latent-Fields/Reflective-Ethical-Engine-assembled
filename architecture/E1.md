> **📍 Canonical Location:** This content has been migrated to [`docs/architecture/e1.md`](../docs/architecture/e1.md) with formal claim typing and dependency tracking. This file is preserved for compatibility.

E1 is the deep, slow predictive core of the Reflective Ethical Engine (REE).  
It is the component responsible for maintaining a coherent model of self, world, and value across time.

E1 is not optimised for speed, action, or immediacy.  
It is optimised for **persistence, reuse, and temporal depth**.

E1 is the substrate that remains when attention drops, action pauses, and commitment disengages.

## 1. Architectural role

E1 sits upstream of E2 (Fast Forward Predictor) and E3 (Trajectory Selection and Commitment Engine).

Its primary roles are:

- Maintaining deep generative models of the world and self
- Representing long-horizon predictions and regimes
- Holding abstract structure independent of immediate action
- Providing stable priors and context to faster systems
- Supporting reuse across domains without collapse

E1 does not directly act and does not directly construct the present.

---

## 2. What E1 represents

E1 maintains a hierarchy of slow-changing latent structures, including:

- World regularities and causal structure
- Self-models and identity continuity
- Social and relational models (including kin relevance)
- Value landscapes and ethical constraints
- Long-horizon outcome expectations
- Narrative and counterfactual structure

These representations are **predictive**, not declarative:  
they encode expectations about how states evolve, not static facts.

---

## 3. Temporal characteristics

E1 operates over long temporal horizons:

- Predictions may span from minutes to lifetimes
- Update rates are slow relative to E2
- Representations are robust to momentary sensory noise

E1 can maintain incompatible or unresolved hypotheses without forcing resolution.

This capacity to *wait without collapse* is essential for imagination, ethics, learning, and care.

---

## 4. Relationship to the latent stack

In the latent stack, E1 primarily stabilises the deeper horizons:

- Workspace / narrative latent \(z_\theta\)
- Regime / value latent \(z_\delta\)

E1 influences faster horizons indirectly by shaping priors and precision landscapes, not by overwriting sensory content.

E1 must remain perceptually corrigible: deep expectations bias inference but are always revisable via error propagated from faster layers.

(see `latent_stack.md`)

## 5. Precision and maintenance

Precision systems do not simply modulate E1’s learning rate.

They **maintain E1’s viability**:

- Sustaining predictive coherence under uncertainty
- Preventing collapse into noise or rigid attractors
- Allowing withdrawal of attention without loss of structure

E1 can persist under reduced precision and reduced engagement, unlike E2 and E3.

This persistence is the basis of continuity of self.

(see `precision_control.md`)

---

## 6. Relationship to E2 and E3

- **E2** uses E1 as a source of priors and context for rapid affordance prediction.
- **E3** evaluates trajectories generated with reference to E1’s deep constraints and value structure.

E1 does not decide trajectories and does not commit actions.

It shapes what *can* be meaningfully decided without enforcing choice.

---

## 7. Emotional and value shaping

E1 is not itself an emotional effector system.

However, it is **sculpted over time** by deep affective predictors:

- reward and harm histories
- uncertainty tolerance
- attachment and kin relevance
- confidence and trust trajectories

These signals do not inject momentary emotion into E1.
They gradually reshape its predictive landscape.

This allows E1 to be:
- content-agnostic,
- yet ethically and personally specific.

---

## 8. Failure modes (deep-core pathologies)

Disruption of E1 yields characteristic failures:

- **Rigidity**  
  over-stable regimes → inflexibility, dogmatism

- **Fragmentation**  
  loss of deep coherence → identity disturbance, narrative collapse

- **Drift**  
  under-constrained updating → loss of value structure, nihilism

- **Overwrite**  
  improper precision dominance → delusion-like fixed beliefs

These are failures of deep predictive maintenance, not fast inference.

---

## 9. Summary

E1 is the persistent predictive substrate of REE.

It:
- holds the world when nothing is happening,
- maintains selfhood across time,
- supports reuse across domains,
- and provides the ethical and structural ground on which action becomes meaningful.

E2 makes the future reachable.  
E3 makes the present lived.  
E1 makes the system coherent enough for either to matter.
