# Trajectory selection (E3)

E3 evaluates candidate sensorimotor futures and **commits** to one trajectory.

E3 is not a perceptual system and does not overwrite the shared sensory latent. Its role is to:
- select a coherent sensorimotor future from an affordance space,
- raise precision on the selected plan (commitment), and
- convert hypothetical rollouts into **learning-relevant** prediction errors after action.

## Inputs and representational domains

REE distinguishes two primary latents:
- **Shared sensory latent** \(z_S\): reliability-weighted, fused multimodal evidence (completed perception).
- **Affordance/action latent** \(z_A\): candidate sensorimotor futures generated by fast forward prediction.

E3 operates on \(z_A\), which is derived from \(z_S\) via E2. E3 does not operate directly on raw modality streams.

## Candidate generation (E2 → \(z_A\))

Generate \(N\) candidate trajectories \(\zeta_i\) by rolling the fast forward predictor (E2) forward from the current shared sensory latent \(z_S\) for horizon \(H\).

Common options:
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) rollouts with random shooting.
- Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) sampling.
- Beam search for discrete action spaces.

## Scoring

Score each candidate with:

\[
J(\zeta)=\mathcal{F}(\zeta)+\lambda\,M(\zeta)+\rho\,\Phi_R(\zeta)
\]

Where (implementation-dependent, but conceptually stable):
- \(\mathcal{F}(\zeta)\): feasibility / coherence / constraint satisfaction (including physical viability and internal consistency across predictive depths).
- \(M(\zeta)\): mission-aligned objective terms (task progress, care objectives, etc.).
- \(\Phi_R(\zeta)\): residue curvature term (persistent ethical cost; path dependent).

## Commitment as precision gating

Temporal collapse and the constructed present

E3 does not select an instantaneous action. It selects a **trajectory through a temporally displaced latent space** whose predictions span multiple future offsets (sensory, motor, procedural, affective).

Commitment performs a *temporal collapse*:
	•	It phase-aligns temporally displaced predictions with motor execution timing
	•	It locks a smeared predictive bundle into an action-relevant frame
	•	It enforces cross-horizon coherence so the trajectory is experienced as a single unfolding “now”

The subjective present therefore corresponds to a **phase-stable, committed trajectory**, not to a time-slice of perception.

Without commitment, temporally displaced rollouts remain exploratory and do not generate a unitary present-moment experience.

Commitment is implemented as a **precision increase** at action/control depth (\(\beta\) and sometimes \(\gamma\)):

- reduce action entropy for the selected plan
- increase weighting of action-level prediction error (stabilises execution)

This corresponds to dopamine-like commitment without requiring a reward-only interpretation.


### Epistemic consequence of commitment

## E3 control plane (precision, gain, and mode tuning)

In addition to trajectory commitment, E3 operates a **control plane** that tunes how the rest of the system runs.
This control plane exposes a registry of tunable parameters across modules and depths, including:

- sensory precision and gain (attention-like modulation over \(z_S\)),
- action and policy precision (commitment strength),
- fast rollout temperature, horizon, and branching factor (E2),
- learning-rate rigidity or plasticity in deep models (E1),
- replay rate and pattern-completion bias (hippocampal braid), and
- operating mode (task-engaged, Default Mode–like, or sleep/offline).

These parameters form a structured tuning surface \(\theta_{\text{tune}}\), updated by E3 based on context,
urgency, residue curvature, and predicted risk or harm.

Neuromodulatory systems in biological cognition can be understood as implementing such a control plane.
In REE, these channels are treated functionally: as precision, gain, stability, urgency, and availability controls,
rather than as reward signals.

Before commitment, rollouts are **hypotheses**. After commitment, the selected trajectory is treated as **intended**.

This matters because only committed outcomes make errors *diagnostic* of the model.
E3 therefore acts as an **epistemic commitment gate**:
- uncommitted rollouts do not trigger belief update
- committed trajectories produce learning-relevant prediction errors after action

## Error routing after action

After executing the committed plan, prediction errors are routed by domain:

- **Perceptual error** (sensory mismatch in \(z_S\)) → updates perceptual priors via error-weighted updates (no semantic overwrite).
- **Affordance / procedural error** (predicted trajectory vs achieved) → updates E2 rollout model (what actions tend to do).
- **Deep model error** (systematic mismatch across contexts) → updates E1 (slow, integrative world/self model).
- **Value mismatch / moral residue** (harm/benefit deviation; constraint violations) → updates residue field \(\phi(z)\) / \(\Phi_R\).


## Attention and precision coupling

## Narrative continuity and safe switching

E3 maintains coherence of agency over time by favouring continuity between successive committed trajectories.

Candidate futures generated by E2 typically share partial prefixes corresponding to near-term sensorimotor structure.
E3 enforces a **safe switching constraint**:

- trajectory switches are preferentially allowed where candidate futures share a sufficient prefix with the current committed plan,
- switches that break near-term coherence incur increasing cost unless overridden by urgency or constraint violation.

This ensures that plan revision occurs at points where futures remain compatible, producing a stable narrative line.

The subjective present (“now”) corresponds to the **decision frontier** where:
- past path memory (hippocampal braid),
- current sensory anchoring (\(z_S\)), and
- multiple predicted futures (\(z_A\))

remain jointly consistent, allowing redirection without loss of self-coherence.

Attention is implemented as **precision (gain) modulation**.
E3 interacts with attention by:
- requesting increased precision on task-relevant sensory channels (to reduce ambiguity during execution), and/or
- lowering precision in internal simulation modes where trajectories are exploratory rather than committed.

In REE, attention changes the *weight* of error signals; it does not inject new sensory content.

## Ethical constraints as architectural consequences

Many practical rules (e.g., avoid harm, prefer benefit, disclose risks/benefits/alternatives to support capacity) can be modelled as
constraints and scoring terms that emerge from the architecture:
- harm/benefit prediction appears naturally as part of scoring candidate futures
- commitment makes outcomes attributable (and therefore ethically and epistemically relevant)
- residue makes ethical cost path dependent and persistent

These rules are therefore not treated as the deepest ethical primitives; they are operational constraints that arise from a cognition
architecture that must act under uncertainty while preserving corrigibility and responsibility.
