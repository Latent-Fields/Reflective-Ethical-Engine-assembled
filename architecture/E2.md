E2 is the fast predictive stream of the Reflective Ethical Engine (REE).  
It performs rapid, low-latency forward inference from the current latent context to near-future sensory expectations and bodily/action affordances.

E2 is not the deep world-model (that is E1).  
E2 is the **fast forward predictor** that makes the near future “reachable” as a structured set of options.

## 1. Architectural role

E2 sits between incoming sensory evidence and the trajectory selection engine (E3):

- Consumes current sensory/latent state (and E1 priors)
- Produces near-term predicted sensory states and action-conditioned outcomes
- Exposes a compact action/affordance surface for E3 to choose trajectories through

E2 is the engine of rapid *perception-for-action*: it keeps the system responsive while E1 maintains slower, deeper structure.

## 2. Inputs and outputs (interface contract)

### Inputs

E2 receives:

- Current sensory evidence \(o_t\) (or encoded features)
- Current shared sensory latent \(z_\gamma(t)\)  
  (see `latent_stack.md`)
- Optional E1 priors / context  
  (slow predictive state and expectations)
- Current precision profile components relevant to fast inference  
  \( \alpha_\gamma, \alpha_\beta \)  
  (see `precision_control.md`)
- Optional motor state / proprioception (for closed-loop affordances)

### Outputs

E2 emits:

- Near-future predicted sensory states  
  \( \hat o_{t:t+\epsilon} \)
- Action-conditioned outcome predictions  
  \( \hat o_{t:t+\epsilon}\,|\,a \)
- Affordance representation / action surface  
  \( z_\beta(t) \) (or equivalent)
- Fast prediction error signals for updating \(z_\gamma\) and informing precision control

## 3. What E2 computes

E2 computes a temporally displaced bundle of predictions at short horizons:

- “If I do nothing, what do I expect to sense next?”
- “If I do action \(a\), what changes in the immediate future?”
- “Which actions are locally feasible and low-cost given the current body/world state?”

This yields an **affordance manifold**: a structured map of immediate possible actions and their predicted consequences.

## 4. Relationship to E1 and the latent stack

E2 and E1 cooperate rather than compete:

- E1 provides deep priors and longer-horizon structure (narrative, goals, affective regime predictors)
- E2 provides short-horizon predictive closure (rapid sensorimotor anticipation)

In REE terms:

- E2 primarily populates the fast horizons of the latent stack  
  (sensory \(z_\gamma\) and action/affordance \(z_\beta\))
- E1 primarily stabilises deeper horizons  
  (workspace \(z_\theta\), regime/value \(z_\delta\), etc.)

E2 should remain perceptually corrigible: it must be able to update against sensory error rather than enforcing top-down overwrite.

---

## 5. Precision coupling and cognitive regimes

Precision control shapes E2’s behaviour:

- High sensory precision (\(\alpha_\gamma\uparrow\))  
  → rapid correction to incoming evidence, perceptual anchoring
- High action-depth precision (\(\alpha_\beta\uparrow\))  
  → sharper affordance selection, faster commitment when E3 engages
- Noradrenaline-like interrupt signals  
  → reset fast expectations, break maladaptive local attractors
- Serotonin-like anti-collapse signals  
  → keep local options open, avoid premature narrowing of affordances

E2 is therefore a key surface where global regulatory state becomes immediate cognitive style.

(see `precision_control.md`)

## 6. Interaction with E3

E2 does not decide. It proposes.

E3 consumes E2’s affordance manifold and action-conditioned predictions, then selects a coherent trajectory that can be committed and lived:

- E2: generates near-future options and local predicted consequences
- E3: selects and commits a trajectory across horizons, constructing the unitary present when licensed

(see `E3.md`)

---

## 7. Failure modes (fast-stream pathologies)

Common failure regimes for E2-like systems:

- **Over-narrow affordances**  
  premature pruning → compulsive loops, reduced flexibility
- **Over-permissive affordances**  
  insufficient pruning → distractibility, unstable control
- **Excessive sensory gain**  
  overload → fragmentation, derealisation-like states
- **Weak sensory correction**  
  top-down drift → false local coherence, hallucination-like errors

These are typically driven by precision misallocation rather than representational “content errors”.

---

## 8. Summary

E2 is the fast forward predictor that converts current context into the immediate future.

It:
- predicts near-term sensory flow,
- maps action-conditioned outcomes,
- generates an affordance manifold,
- and provides the fast substrate that E3 can collapse into lived experience.

Without E2, REE is slow and brittle.
With E2, REE is responsive.
