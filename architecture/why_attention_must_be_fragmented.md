Why Attention Must Be Fragmented

⸻

Status

Normative architectural rationale

This document explains why REE treats “attention” not as a single mechanism, but as a fragmented control surface distributed across multiple orthogonal dimensions. This fragmentation is not an implementation detail; it is a safety and coherence requirement.

⸻

1. The Problem with Unitary Attention

Modern AI architectures often treat attention as:
	•	a single scalar or vector field
	•	applied uniformly across representations
	•	responsible for relevance, learning, and action selection

This leads to an implicit assumption:

If the system attends strongly to something, it should both learn from it and act on it.

Biological cognition violates this assumption everywhere.

REE must violate it too.

⸻

2. Attention Is Not One Thing

In REE, “attention” decomposes into three independent questions:
	1.	How much should this signal influence local updating?
	2.	How urgently must the system commit or reorient?
	3.	How exclusive must interpretations be?

A single mechanism cannot answer all three without contradiction.

⸻

3. The Three Control Axes (Canonical)

REE therefore fragments attention into three orthogonal control axes, each implemented as a separate modulation channel:

Axis	Signal	Governs	Core Question
Precision	Dopamine-like	Error influence (πτ)	How much should this matter locally?
Commitment Pressure	Noradrenaline-like	Path authority & interruptibility	Must I act or reorient now?
Exclusivity / Collapse	Serotonin-like	Hypothesis pruning & plasticity	Must I choose one interpretation?

No axis substitutes for another.
No axis writes to the same register.

⸻

4. Fragmentation Preserves Logical Consistency

4.1 Separation of Learning and Acting
	•	Dopamine-like precision updates learning without forcing action
	•	Noradrenaline-like urgency forces action without rewriting belief
	•	Serotonin-like collapse governs belief structure without urgency

This prevents classic failure modes:
	•	surprise → certainty
	•	urgency → belief rigidity
	•	salience → value corruption

⸻

4.2 Separation of Imagination and Commitment
	•	θ-level paths may proliferate freely
	•	serotonin permits coexistence
	•	noradrenaline determines whether choice is forced
	•	E3 commits only after constraints are satisfied

Thus:

The system can imagine without acting, and act without believing prematurely.

⸻

5. Fragmentation Across τ (Temporal Depth)

Attention-like effects are τ-scoped, not global.
	•	γ always updates (sensorium never pauses)
	•	β tracks affordances continuously
	•	θ simulates futures without obligation
	•	δ maintains slow constraints

Fragmented attention ensures:
	•	γ salience does not become δ certainty
	•	θ imagination does not become β compulsion
	•	δ identity does not micromanage γ perception

⸻

6. Fragmentation Across ρ (Representational Depth)

Similarly, attention must not collapse abstraction levels.
	•	serotonin regulates ρ-level exclusivity
	•	dopamine regulates ρ-local learning
	•	noradrenaline regulates ρ-crossing urgency

This allows:
	•	multiple perceptual narratives
	•	plural futures
	•	revisable identities

without loss of coherence.

⸻

7. Why “Attention Is All You Need” Is Incomplete

The phrase is directionally right but structurally wrong.

What is actually needed is:

Fragmented attention with typed authority.

A single attention mechanism cannot safely decide:
	•	what to learn,
	•	what to do,
	•	what to believe,
	•	and what to discard.

REE enforces this separation architecturally, not heuristically.

⸻

8. Alignment Implications (Non-Optional)

If attention is not fragmented:
	•	reward spikes rewrite values
	•	rare events dominate policy
	•	internal simulations compel action
	•	identity collapses under noise

Fragmentation ensures:
	•	learning is conservative
	•	commitment is contextual
	•	belief revision is protected
	•	imagination remains safe

This is alignment by structure, not by objective tuning.

⸻

9. Axiomatic Summary (Safe to Quote)

You can safely include the following as a design axiom:

Attention is not a unitary resource.
Any system that learns, imagines, and acts under uncertainty must fragment attention into orthogonal control axes governing precision, urgency, and representational collapse.

10. Relationship to the Rest of REE

This document underwrites:
	•	precision_scoping.md
	•	path_authority_and_interrupts.md
	•	serotonin.md
	•	the τ × ρ × φ coordinate system
	•	the non-compilability of ethics

Without fragmented attention, REE degenerates into an optimiser.
With it, REE remains a viable cognitive architecture.

⸻

11. Summary
	•	Attention is control, not content
	•	Control has multiple irreducible dimensions
	•	Fragmentation prevents pathological collapse
	•	REE encodes this explicitly and normatively
