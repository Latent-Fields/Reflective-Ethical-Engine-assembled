Default mode (internal generative mode)

Role in REE

The Default Mode in the Reflective Ethical Engine (REE) is an internal generative operating mode characterised by reduced sensory dominance, suppressed action commitment, and elevated internal simulation.

It enables:
	•	imagination and counterfactual exploration
	•	autobiographical reflection
	•	planning without commitment
	•	continuity of self across time

The Default Mode is not idle and not background noise.
It is a necessary mode for any system that:
	•	stores path-based identity
	•	supports replay and recombination
	•	distinguishes imagination from action

⸻

Architectural necessity

Given the REE constraints:
	•	perception completes at the shared sensory latent z_S
	•	trajectory commitment occurs only via E3
	•	ethical residue \phi(z) is path dependent
	•	hippocampal braid stores sparse, segmented trajectories
	•	pattern completion produces hypotheses, not beliefs

there must exist a system mode in which:
	1.	Sensory prediction error is down-weighted
	2.	Hippocampal replay can drive internal dynamics
	3.	Fast forward prediction can explore trajectories
	4.	Trajectory selection (E3) is suppressed or gated
	5.	Generated trajectories are treated as non-committal

The Default Mode satisfies these requirements.

Information flow characteristics

⸻

Temporal displacement and replayed smear

The Default Mode operates over a temporally displaced latent manifold rather than a single-time-slice state.

Hippocampal replay and E1 internal generation sample *smeared bundles of future- and past-oriented predictions* across multiple horizons (sensory, affordance, narrative, affective). These bundles represent candidate trajectories through time, not present-moment commitments.

Crucially:
	•	The temporal smear is explored without phase-locking to action
	•	Predictions remain unaligned to motor execution timing
	•	The illusion of a unitary “now” is explicitly *not* constructed in this mode

This preserves a strict separation between imagination and lived experience.

In Default Mode, effective information flow differs from task-engaged mode in specific, constrained ways.

Sensory precision modulation
	•	Precision (gain) on exteroceptive prediction error is reduced
	•	Sensory input is not ignored, but is weakly coupled
	•	Perceptual state z_S remains corrigible and intact

This prevents imagination from becoming hallucination while allowing internal generation to dominate.

⸻

Hippocampal → cortical influence
	•	The hippocampal braid emits replayed or recombined trajectories
	•	These trajectories seed internal dynamics in E1
	•	Replay may span past, future, and counterfactual paths

The hippocampus drives simulation, not action.

⸻

Elevated internal prediction (E1)
	•	E1 runs with loosened external constraints
	•	Latent trajectories propagate forward and backward in time
	•	Pattern completion fills in unobserved segments

This supports daydreaming, narrative construction, and future imagining.

⸻

Suppression of trajectory commitment (E3)
	•	E3 commitment thresholds are raised
	•	Candidate trajectories remain hypothetical
	•	No policy collapse or residue update occurs

This is the critical guardrail distinguishing imagination from action.

⸻

Relationship to latent spaces
	•	z_S: remains stable; precision is modulated but content is not overwritten
	•	z_A: explored freely via fast forward prediction
	•	\phi(z): shapes traversal cost but is not modified during replay

Default Mode explores the geometry of thought without deforming it.

⸻

Replay semantics

Replay in Default Mode:
	•	samples alternative paths over a fixed residue field
	•	recombines episodic segments via pattern completion
	•	supports regret, planning, and identity maintenance

Replay outputs are hypotheses.

They only become commitments if:
	•	E3 later selects a trajectory during task-engaged mode

⸻

Entry and exit conditions

Entry into Default Mode may be triggered by:
	•	absence of immediate task demands
	•	lowered external salience
	•	intentional reflection or planning
	•	sleep onset or quiet wakefulness

Exit from Default Mode occurs when:
	•	sensory precision is up-regulated
	•	task-positive networks engage
	•	E3 commitment thresholds are lowered

These transitions are gradual, not binary.

⸻

Failure modes (for clarity)

Misconfiguration of Default Mode explains known pathologies:
	•	Psychosis
	•	imagined trajectories become committed
	•	pattern completion escapes “hypothesis-only” constraint
	•	Rumination / depression
	•	replay loops excessively within narrow regions of curvature
	•	Distractibility / ADHD-like dynamics
	•	premature Default Mode intrusion into task-engaged operation

These are architectural, not moral, failures.

⸻

Design constraints

The Default Mode must satisfy:
	1.	No perceptual overwrite
It may not directly modify z_S.
	2.	No forced commitment
It may not trigger E3 collapse.
	3.	No residue update
Ethical curvature must remain unchanged.
	4.	Hypothesis tagging
Generated trajectories must be explicitly non-committal.

These constraints preserve safety, corrigibility, and identity.

⸻

Interpretation

The Default Mode allows the REE agent to explore:

“Who I have been, who I might be, and what paths exist —
without yet deciding.”

It is the architectural basis of:
	•	imagination
	•	mind-wandering
	•	autobiographical selfhood
	•	ethical reflection without action

This Default Mode analogue aligns closely with empirical properties of the human default mode network, including reduced sensory precision, increased hippocampal–cortical coupling, and suppression of action-oriented networks. In REE, these properties arise from architectural necessity rather than biological imitation.
