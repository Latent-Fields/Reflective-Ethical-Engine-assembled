# Residue Integration

Moral residue represents persistent deformation of latent space caused by harm.

Sleep-phase residue integration should:
- Preserve the fact that harm occurred
- Tie residue to the correct contexts
- Prevent global overgeneralisation
- Compress residue into efficient representations

Failure modes addressed:
- Moral injury overload
- Spurious guilt / avoidance
- Loss of traversability in trajectory space
