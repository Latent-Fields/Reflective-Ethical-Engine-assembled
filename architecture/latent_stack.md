# Latent stack (L-space)

REE uses a multi-timescale latent stack to represent temporally displaced prediction depths operating over two primary representational domains:
(1) a **shared sensory latent** that fuses modality-specific evidence, and
(2) a downstream **affordance / action latent** generated by fast forward prediction.

## Minimal implementation interface

Implement each depth \(k\in\{\gamma,\beta,\theta,\delta\}\) with:

- `encode_k(o_t, prev_state)` → `z_k(t)`
- `predict_k(z_k(t))` → `z_k(t+1)`
- `topdown_kplus1_to_k(z_{k+1}(t))` → prior / conditioning signal for depth \(k\)

## Interpretation

The latent stack is organised by **timescale**, not by sensory modality.
Sensory modalities are fused *before* entering the stack into a shared sensory latent \(z_S\).

- **\(z_\gamma\)**: shared sensory binding / feature conjunction (multimodal evidence + precision).
  This level represents the completed perceptual state \(z_S\).

- **\(z_\beta\)**: affordance and immediate action-set maintenance.
  Fast forward predictions from \(z_\gamma\) expand into a candidate affordance/action latent \(z_A\).

- **\(z_\theta\)**: sequence context, temporal ordering, and short-horizon narrative structure
  over candidate trajectories.

- **\(z_\delta\)**: regime, motivational set, long-horizon context, and default-mode attractor
  that biases selection but does not overwrite perception.

Downstream processes may not directly overwrite \(z_\gamma\); influence is restricted to
prediction-error updates and precision (gain) modulation.

REE does not require explicit oscillations for v0. Oscillatory phase can be added later as a scheduling / gating mechanism.

This separation preserves perceptual corrigibility: illusions and misperceptions arise from
misweighted precision or suppressed error, not from semantic overwrite of sensory state.
