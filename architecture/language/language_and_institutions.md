# Language, Institutions, and Collective Agents

In collective systems, language becomes the primary medium
through which ethical residue is managed or displaced.

Institutions may:
- absorb residue (protecting individuals),
- diffuse residue (losing accountability),
- or deny residue (systemic harm).

REE predicts ethical failure in institutions arises when symbolic language
fully decouples from embodied harm signals and residue tracking.
