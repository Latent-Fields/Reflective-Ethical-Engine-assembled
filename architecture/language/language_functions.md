# Core Functions of Language in REE

Language serves four primary functions:

1. Compression
   - Collapses high-dimensional experience into symbolic form
   - Enables long-horizon planning and memory

2. Social Transmission
   - Allows residue, norms, warnings, and constraints to propagate between agents
   - Extends ethical learning beyond direct experience

3. Coordination
   - Aligns expectations and trajectories among multiple agents
   - Reduces conflict via shared predictive frames

4. Temporal Bridging
   - Links past residue to future intention
   - Supports promises, commitments, and repair

### Externalised internal state (overhead reduction)
A key architectural role is exporting summaries of internal processes:
- "I am harmed / at risk"
- "This trajectory is scarred"
- "I intend X"
- "I am uncertain"

This reduces the need for other agents to reconstruct those states by costly inference.
Language does NOT generate ethics; it reshapes the space in which ethical selection occurs.
