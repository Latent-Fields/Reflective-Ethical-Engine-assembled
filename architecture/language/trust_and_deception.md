# Trust, Reliability, and Deception

Because language conditions priors, REE must treat symbolic input as:
- informative but not authoritative.

### Trust-weighting
The receiver maintains an estimate of sender reliability:
- consistency with observed outcomes,
- alignment with harm signals,
- history of calibration (confidence vs accuracy).

Symbolic updates are weighted by this reliability estimate.

### Deception risks
Language introduces attack surfaces:
- false harm claims,
- false commitments,
- ideological framing,
- reputational laundering.

REE predicts robust systems will:
- cross-check language against embodied harm and world-model prediction,
- penalise repeated miscalibration via reduced trust-weight.
