# Emergence & Bootstrapping

REE predicts that language-like signalling emerges when:
- agents have private internal state (interoception/homeostasis),
- must model others under partial observability,
- benefit from coordination,
- plan over longer horizons,
- and operate under compute/attention limits.

### Bootstrapping sequence (human-analogous but implementation-agnostic)
1. Affective signalling (low-bandwidth, high-salience): distress, aversion, approach cues
2. Attentional biases: agent/face-like feature attention; gaze-following analogues
3. Proto-symbols: repeated signals tied to stable contexts ("danger", "stop", "help")
4. Symbolic compression: compositional messages that condition priors and plans
5. Normative layer: shared expectations transmitted socially (still constrained by embodied harm)

### Minimal requirement
REE does not require pre-defined grammar or symbols—only a channel for exporting internal summaries that can update others' priors.
