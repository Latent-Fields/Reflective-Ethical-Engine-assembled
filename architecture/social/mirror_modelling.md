# Mirror Modelling

## Definition
Mirror modelling is the reuse of the **self generative model**
to simulate other agents, with reduced coupling and without interoceptive closure.

It enables:
- prediction of others' behaviour,
- empathy as predicted self-like degradation,
- generalisation of harm without explicit moral rules.

## Mechanism
- Same latent variables as self-model (shared L-space)
- Lower precision gains (alpha_k reduced)
- No direct interoceptive error correction
- Coupling strength modulates empathic resonance

## Harm Equivalence Principle
Predicted degradation in a mirrored other-model
is treated as homologous to degradation of the self,
discounted by coupling strength.

## Role in Ethics
Mirror modelling is the primary pathway by which:
- harm-to-other contributes to ethical cost M(zeta)
- moral residue R forms without direct self-harm

## Failure Modes
- Low gain: psychopathy / callousness
- Excessive gain: empathic overwhelm / paralysis
- Miscalibrated gain: burnout, moral injury
