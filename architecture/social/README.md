# Social Cognition (REE)

This folder specifies **social cognition mechanisms** in the Reflective-Ethical Engine (REE).

Social cognition in REE is grounded in:
- reuse of the self generative model,
- precision-weighted coupling to others,
- and persistence of harm via moral residue.

It precedes language and enables empathy, coordination,
and ethical generalisation without symbolic rules.
