# Social Coupling

Social coupling determines how strongly mirrored models influence selection.

## Coupling Factors
- Structural similarity
- Temporal synchrony
- History of interaction
- Language-mediated trust signals

## Coupling Effects
- Scales harm equivalence contribution
- Modulates ethical cost M
- Affects residue accumulation

## Dynamics
Coupling is:
- context-dependent,
- history-sensitive,
- recalibrated during offline sleep.

This allows empathy without global collapse.
