# Otherness Inference

REE distinguishes self from other via coupling structure.

## Self
- Tight action–prediction coupling
- Interoceptive and proprioceptive closure
- High precision on internal error signals

## Other
- Structural similarity to self-model
- Loose coupling
- No interoceptive closure

Otherness is inferred when an entity:
- behaves coherently,
- predicts similarly to self,
- but does not respond to self action commands.

This avoids symbolic identity assignment.
